What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?
In Python, a tuple is a collection of ordered, immutable elements. Some of the key characteristics of tuples include:
Tuples are ordered: The elements in a tuple are ordered and each element can be accessed by its index.
Tuples can contain mixed data types: Unlike lists, tuples can contain elements of different data types.
Tuples are immutable: Once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed. This means that you cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.
Tuples are faster than lists: Because tuples are immutable, they can be processed faster than lists.
Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries: Because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries. Lists cannot be used as keys in dictionaries because they are mutable.
So, yes, tuples are immutable in Python. Once a tuple is created, it cannot be modified. If you need to modify a tuple, you will need to create a new tuple with the desired modifications.
