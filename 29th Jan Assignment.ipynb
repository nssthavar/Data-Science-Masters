    "#### 1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s while he was working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands (CWI). He named it after the Monty Python comedy group, of which he was a big fan. Guido van Rossum continued to lead the development of Python until he retired in 2018. Today, the Python community contributes to the ongoing development and maintenance of the language."

    "#### 2. Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "Python is a versatile programming language that supports several programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural programming: Writing code that consists of a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming: Writing code that organizes data and functions into classes, objects, and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming: Writing code that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aspect-oriented programming: Writing code that separates cross-cutting concerns such as logging and error handling from the main logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports several programming styles, such as imperative, declarative, and event-driven programming. This flexibility makes Python suitable for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning."

    "#### 3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers? \n",
    "Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that identifiers such as variable names, function names, and class names in Python are distinguished by case. For example, a variable named \"my_var\" is different from a variable named \"my_Var\" or \"My_var\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to be consistent in your use of identifiers throughout your Python code. Using inconsistent capitalization can result in errors, as Python will treat the identifiers as separate entities. It's a good practice to use lowercase letters for variable names and function names and uppercase letters for class names in Python.\n",

    "#### 4. What is the correct extension of the Python file? \n",
    "The correct extension for a Python file is \".py\". When you save a Python program to a file, you should give it a name that ends with \".py\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a Python program called \"hello_world.py\", you would run it by typing \"python hello_world.py\" in the command line. The \".py\" extension tells the operating system that the file is a Python program and should be executed using the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to use the correct file extension, as it helps other developers and users understand the type of file and what it is used for. Additionally, some text editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) use file extensions to provide syntax highlighting and other features specific to the programming language."

    "#### 5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is not compiled directly into machine code that can be executed by the computer. Instead, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Python program, the source code is first parsed and compiled into bytecode by the Python interpreter. This bytecode is a low-level representation of the code that can be executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The PVM then runs the bytecode and executes the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of interpreted languages like Python is that they are easy to learn, write, and debug. Changes to the source code can be made quickly and tested without the need for a time-consuming compilation process. However, interpreted languages may be slower than compiled languages because the interpreter must process the code at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize the performance of Python programs, various techniques are used, such as just-in-time compilation, which compiles frequently executed code into machine code at runtime."

    "#### 6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language? \n",
    "In Python, blocks of code are defined using indentation. Indentation is a way to group statements together to form a code block. Here are a few examples of blocks of code used in Python:\n",
    "\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    # code block for False condition\n",

    "4.Loop block:\n",
    "    for item in iterable:\n",

    "    try:\n",

    "In Python, you can add a single-line comment by using the hash character #. Anything that comes after the hash character on a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter. Here's an example:\n",

    "# This is a single-line comment in Python\n",

    "Simple and easy to learn: Python has a clean and simple syntax, making it easy to learn and read. Its readability and straightforward syntax reduce the cost of program maintenance and development.\n",

    "\n",
    "Third-party libraries: Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools that extend its functionality beyond the standard library. These libraries provide a wide range of capabilities for tasks such as data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Productivity and speed: Python's high-level and expressive nature enables programmers to write code quickly and efficiently. Python has an interactive mode, which means it can be used for rapid prototyping, testing, and debugging. Additionally, Python's built-in profiling and debugging tools help to optimize the code for faster execution.\n",

    "#### 14. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python manages memory automatically through a mechanism known as \"garbage collection\". This means that the programmer does not need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory like in some other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of how memory management works in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory allocation: When a new object is created in Python, the interpreter allocates memory for it from the heap. The size of the memory block allocated depends on the type and size of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference counting: Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of how many references (i.e., variables or other objects that point to the same memory location) an object has. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is no longer accessible and is marked for garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collection: Python's garbage collector periodically checks the heap for objects that are no longer accessible (i.e., have a reference count of zero) and frees their memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's garbage collector uses a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting algorithm to manage memory. The cycle-detecting algorithm identifies and breaks reference cycles (i.e., circular references between objects) to ensure that all objects can be properly garbage collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to garbage collection, Python provides other memory management features such as object caching, which reuses objects instead of creating new ones, and memory profiling tools, which help to identify memory leaks and optimize memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's memory management is designed to be automatic and efficient, allowing developers to focus on writing code without having to worry about low-level memory management tasks.\n"

    "\n",
    "Click on \"Advanced system settings\" and then select the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under \"System Variables\", scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable. Click on \"Edit\" to modify it.\n",

    "Click \"OK\" to close all the windows and save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test if the path variables are set up correctly, open a new command prompt and type \"python\". This should open the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! You have now installed Python on Windows and set up the path variables. You can start writing and running Python programs by opening a text editor and saving your code with a \".py\" extension, then running it from the command prompt using the command \"python filename.py\"."

    "\n",
    "Yes, indentation is required in Python. In fact, Python uses indentation to indicate blocks of code. This is different from many other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords like \"begin\" and \"end\" to delimit code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
